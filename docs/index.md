SERPS is a scraping library for php. It considerably decreases the complexity required to analyse search engines.

What is it?
-----------

Serps is a set of tools that ease the parsing of **popular search engines** (such as google, yahoo or bing).
It helps to parse **SERP** (Search Engine Result Page) and gives you a standard output of what is parsed.

The problem
-----------

Most of times search engines don't want you to parse them, and they don't offer a documentation or a standard way 
to extract the results from the SERP and it's hard to write and maintain a scraper.

The solution
------------

To solve this problems we **analysed** how search engines behave and we built the necessary tools to
work with them, from the URL generation to the parsing of the results. 
At the endpoint we offer a **standard and documented API**.

Getting Started
---------------
